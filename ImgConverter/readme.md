# ImgConverter

Actually, it's a simple program only used for some specific situations.

For example, you were asked to hand in an online assignment, but you thought it was inconvenient to finish this assignment with computer and you decided to use handwriting. 


You took a picture of your assigment like this with all things done:
![test](img\test.jpg)

Honestly speaking, we will get pictures like that using our phone most of the time, we found it was somewhat blur and unclear due to the exsisting shadow, and you wanted it to be more clear.

Here comes our ImgConverter, which can help you convert this image to Black-and-White pictures with customized conversion factor(0~255).

For example, set factor = 125, and we get pic below:
![test](img\new_test125.jpg)

Actually it's not a suitable factor for this case, hence we try to make it whiter.Set factor = 100, we get pic below:
![test](img\new_test100.jpg)

Now we get a more clear assigment picture and we can finally hand it to our teacher!
